- I think deeply about things and want others to do likewise. I work for ideas and learn from people. I don't like excluding people. I'm a perfectionist, but I won't let that get in the way of publication. Except for education and entertainment, I'm not going to waste my time on things that won't have an impact. I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don't take me seriously. I don't hold grudges, it's not productive, but I learn from my experience. I want to make the world a better place. __*― Aaron Swartz*__

- People think of education as something they can finish. __*― Isaac Asimov*__

- Be as simple as you can be; you will be astonished to see how uncomplicated and happy your life can become. __*― Paramahansa Yogananda*__

- Study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in. __*― Leonardo da Vinci*__

- Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon. __*― E.M. Forster*__

- The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don't know how to be submissive, and so on -- because they're dysfunctional to the institutions. __*― Noam Chomsky*__
