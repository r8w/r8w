# Poerty

Occasionally, I enjoy reading Poems. Sometimes, I stumble upon great lines on the Internet that touches my heart. Here, I intend to maintain the list of gems that I encounter.

I'll put some pieces here, but the rest of them will be available on [r8w@dump](https://r8w.github.io/notes).

“Even <br>
 After <br>
 All this time <br>
 The Sun never says to the Earth, <br>

 "You owe me."

 Look <br>
 What happens <br>
 With a love like that, <br>
 It lights the whole sky.” <br>

*― Hafiz*
