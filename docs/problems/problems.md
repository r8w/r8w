__Introduction__

I'm highly unsatisfied by the Indian Education System, and I wish I could do something, but it's a long way to go. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to see Indian Education System the way I want to see, but it's okay. I'm willing to put my words out, doesn't matter if anyone reads it or not.

This section contains quite a few things:

- Flaws of Indian Education System
- Related news
- Resources
- What Government is doing?
- My Opinion
