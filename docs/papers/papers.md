# Papers & Journals

I occasionally read research papers. Topics aren't usually decided, so I read either due to its interesting title or because of my interest. So far, I haven't read many, but I'm trying to build this habit where I'll put some effort to read and understand at least one paper in a month.

Numbers aren't a huge factor here. Sometimes, it takes months to read a paper, and sometimes it takes weeks. I'm interested in better content for the sake of knowledge and information. I hope I get to build this habit and stick to it for a while.

__NOTE:__ The idea is not to grasp the bits and pieces, but to find the missing bits through them and build a habit which I'll use rarely.
