# CSE Course

The sub-sections of this section will contains three things - Courses, Links, and Notes. While it may look like it's similar to Library, but the only goal of the [CSE](../library/cs) in [Library](../books) is to maintain an archive for interesting books.

Unlike the Library, this section is not a dump. Everything here is limited and cherry-picked because that's what I'm studying.
