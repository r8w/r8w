# CSE Course

The sub-sections of this section will contains three things - Courses, Links, and Notes. While it may look like it's similar to Library, but the only goal of the [CSE](../docs/library/cs) in [Library](../docs/books) is to maintain an archive for interesting books.

Unlike the Library, this section is not a dump. Everything here is limited and cherry-picked because that's what I'm studying.
<!-- {: .fs-6 .fw-300 } -->

This section is only for my B.Tech studies. Rest of the courses are listed under [Online Courses](../docs/online).
