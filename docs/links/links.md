# Links

Managing bookmarks is the hardest thing ever, or maybe it's hard because I'm bad at managing stuff. Raindrop was the last attempt to keep everything related to URLs at one place, and it's going well.

Raindrop is efficient when it comes to saving links, but I found it a little inefficient when trying to categorize the links. The usage of the mouse to create, choose, and drop URLs into specific categories is time taking.

I've always preferred using Markdown for almost everything related to writing, so I'll do the same here.
