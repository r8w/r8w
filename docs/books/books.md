# Books

This section deals with books, and the scope is limited to the names. It's more of a library. Nothing is opinionated here. There's no garbage can be found in any of the sub-sections. I've avoided what didn't or doesn't interests me.

I'm not an avid reader, but I like the idea of having some reading. I dislike the term "bibliophile".
