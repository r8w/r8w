# Certifications

__*Courses I'm doing for the sake of certificates.*__

I'm not going to philosophize anything. I'm not sure how much of the importance certifications hold, but I think it's okay if you've got a few of them, or one. I don't know. I'm only interested in a couple of them.

__*Why am I even explaining?*__
