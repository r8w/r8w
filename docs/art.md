# Art


*“It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.”*

__*― Vincent Van Gogh*__

I don't paint. I don't want to use mouse. I don't have a sketch-pad which I can use to draw what my mind wants me to, but some days, I feel like I should paint something, although the results are never good, I enjoy doing it.
