# Art


*“It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is well done.”*

__*― Vincent Van Gogh*__

I don't paint. I don't want to use mouse. I don't have a sketch-pad which I can use to draw what my mind wants me to, but some days, I feel like I should paint something, although the results are never good, I enjoy doing it.

- The paintings can be found here -
	- [Hallucinating Sky](/media/7.jpg)
	- [Moon and the River](/media/6.jpg)
	- [Night Sky](/media/2.png)
	- [Forest in a Dream](/media/3.png)
	- [Shadow of Sun](/media/5.png)
	- [Blue Sunset](/media/8.png)

__Update__

- I now have an art account - [@iama_rishi.xyz](https://instagram.com/iama_rishi.art)
- I bought the Wacom One Graphic Tablet, but I don't use it for drawing.
