# Movies & TV Shows

Watch good movies. Keep the track.

## For Movies..

I'm not a movie buff, and I've watched a handful of movies in my life. Some I watched because I had free time, some I watched because I was curious, some I watched due to people I'm friends with and some movies I've watched with a friend on Netflix. Thanks to Teleparty.

I can't watch anything that I stumble upon, and I don't, but once in a while, I feel like I should try to see what cinema has to offer. Only a handful of time I've been disappointed.

I don't have a Netflix account, but I'm thankful to Taavishi for sharing her password. Sometimes, I watch movies with her using Teleparty. It's the only time I log into her account. These days, I need motivation and company to watch a movie. She's a fine human being and a good sport.

Below is a list of movies that I've watched and liked. I know I might miss a lot of them, but it doesn’t matter. If I get to remember the names, I’ll add them to the list. I'm using __ICheckMovies__ to keep the track.

## For TV Shows...

Never been disappointed with any of the shows I've watched so far, but again, I haven't watched too much of the shows, but I'm not disappointed either.
