# Notes

__Introduction__

God gave me two brain cells, and this makes everything hard for me. If I don't write, I won't remember.

__How's this different from other sections which have *notes*__?

This note-taking section is course-independent. Topics are undecided. Everything will be written during the process of learning and understanding.

- All the notes will be dumped at [r8w @ notes](https://r8w.github.io/notes){:target="_blank"}
