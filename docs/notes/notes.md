# Notes

__Introduction__

Low Level Humor

God gave me two brain cells, and this makes everything hard for me. Imagine using Google Chrome in a laptop that has only 2GB of RAM. That is me with all the information in the brain. Everything keeps crashing, and I keep forgetting. 

One of the reasons why I write down things when I'm studying because if I don't, only God will be able to help me. So, the chances of getting help are olive-sized.

__How's this different from other sections which have *notes*__?

This Note-taking section is course-independent. Topics are undecided. Everything will be written during the process of learning and understanding.
