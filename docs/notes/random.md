# Random Notes

Just like others, even I don't spend all of my time reading things related to Computer Science. I've got some hobbies, and there are tons of topics I'm interested in, for example, History.

This section is to put the notes related to everything that I read on the internet that has nothing to do with the world of Computer Science or Programming. Short notes are fine. Avoid writing essays. The end goal is to keep the important things in my mind.
