# Society

*We don't live in society; we survive in it.*

---

During the initial days, I used to think that improving the education system would eradicate society's ample amount of issues. As I grew up, my thoughts changed, and it's still shifting. The narrative doesn't remain the same. It has to change. A palace built on a swamp has to sink if we care about strengthening only one of its pillars and ignoring the rest.

Now, I consider education one of the pillars of society. It standalone can't help an individual or a group of individuals to grow and flourish. I have no faith in idealism, but before we fix the pillars, we've to strengthen the foundation, too. With correct strategies, we can make progress on both sides of this massive infrastructure called humans.

What's the foundation, then?

I don't have the answers, but I'm willing to look at all the aspects to find common ground. India can't be like other countries. I often find it surprising that how badly the population gets ignored when we keep overall development in perspective. With massive population comes massive division. The more divisions we have, the more work needs to be done.

The goal is not to find one efficient solution but many, at least this is what I believe. I do care about the education system, but it has shifted below in my priority list.

This section is an attempt to find efficient answers, implementable solutions, and approachable ideas. I'm not writing anything for anyone but myself.
