# notes @ cs / web

__*Everything Computer Science & Web*__

---

This note-taking section is topic-dependent, and the scope is limited to the areas of the computer. Topics are undecided.

The initial goal of this section was limited to note-taking, but I'm expanding the arc to include a few more things, and it specifically does not include taking notes. I know it's contradictory, but it is what it is.

<!-- __How's this different from other sections which have *notes*__?


- All the notes will be dumped at [r8w @ notes](https://r8w.github.io/notes){:target="_blank"}
