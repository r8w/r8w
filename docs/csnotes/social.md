# Social Media

Garbage
{: .label .label-red}


Everything here is my opinion on what I think about the posts that I get to read on the Social Media sites. I'm entitled to my opinion. With the passage of time, everything changes, including opinions.

I've almost quit using Facebook, but I'm on Twitter and Instagram, and that's the place from where I get the most of the negativity.
