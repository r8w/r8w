# Poerty

*“Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.”*

*__--- Plato__*

I thoroughly enjoy poetry, and occasionally,  when I stumble upon some absolute gems, I save them but never find them again. Unfortunate.

This section aims to act as a lane with organized packages of rhymes.

“Even <br>
 After <br>
 All this time <br>
 The Sun never says to the Earth, <br>

 "You owe me."

 Look <br>
 What happens <br>
 With a love like that, <br>
 It lights the whole sky.” <br>

*― Hafiz*
