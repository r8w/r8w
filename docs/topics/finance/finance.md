# Finance
{: .no_toc }

>  *Finance is a broad term that describes activities associated with banking, leverage or debt, credit, capital markets, money, and investments. Basically, finance represents money management and the process of acquiring needed funds. Finance also encompasses the oversight, creation, and study of money, banking, credit, investments, assets, and liabilities that make up financial systems.*

> *Many of the basic concepts in finance originate from microeconomic and macroeconomic theories. One of the most fundamental theories is the time value of money, which essentially states that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.*

The correct naming for this section would be __Economics__, but I'm not willing to change it now. That's because I'm lazy.
